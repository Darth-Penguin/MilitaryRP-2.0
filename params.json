Basically, it's DarkRP, just even more military themed.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Why is this on GitHub?\r\nBecause I like to keep back up files in case I come across an coding accident. Good to keep back ups.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Can I use these files?\r\nSure. But you'll be banned from my server and anybody who comes across \"your\" server will spite you for copying my code.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## This isn't the whole gamemode? Where is it?\r\nI don't want anybody coming along and just making their own MilitaryRP 2.0. So I have only included certain files like the jobs file, and weapon shipments file because those are the files that are annoying to make.\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
