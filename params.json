Basically, it's DarkRP, just even more military themed.\r\n\r\n# Why is this on GitHub?\r\nBecause I like to keep back up files in case I come across an coding accident. Good to keep back ups.\r\n\r\n# Can I use these files?\r\nSure. But you'll be banned from my server and anybody who comes across \"your\" server will spite you for copying my code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
